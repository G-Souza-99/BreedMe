The Purpose of the App
--------------
This app is aimed at fixing a small problem that few pet owners who want to breed their pets know. The hassle of finding someone to breed your pet that is from a specific breed during a the period of your pet's heat.

The app aims to fix this by providing a space for other pet breeders to add in their pets as a solution to find other breeders who also need/want to breed their pet.

This Rails Web-App was developed by [@G-Souza-99](https://github.com/G-Souza-99), [@louro-ines](https://github.com/louro-ines), [@catiafalagueira](https://github.com/catiafalagueira) and as part of a sprint in which we had to develop an app from start to finish. It was generated using the [lewagon templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates) during our time in the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com)

The initial idea was based as a tindr for pets but after scoping out what happend to previous attempts of such ideas we decided to take a diffrent approach but with the same general idea.
